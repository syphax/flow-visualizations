# Marathon Trials Visualization

The objective of this project is to visualize the 2024 US Marathon trials races, using mile-by-mile splits for each runner.

The idea is to show the location of each runner relative to the 3rd place runner (as the top 3* qualify for the Olympic marathon).

I decided to use a slider, as opposed to a fixed animation, to enable the impatient user to jump across to various points of the race.
